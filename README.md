<h2>KATTIS SOLUTIONS</h2>

<p>Just sharing the codes I have used for these listed questions.
Do not plagarise. Instead, try before you see it.
Refrain from memorizing and copying; understand it.

If you have ways to improve mine, feel free to pull requests.
Have a good day!

Credits to my lecturer, teaching assistant and google for enabling me to solve all these.
